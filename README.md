Sales Forecasting using Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)


📌 Overview
This project implements a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to forecast weekly retail sales and provide actionable inventory management insights. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions for stocking, procurement, and cost optimization.

By leveraging the TFT architecture, the model captures long-term temporal dependencies, seasonality patterns, and multiple covariates to deliver highly accurate forecasts.

🎯 Key Features
High Accuracy: Achieved 92.4% MAPE accuracy, outperforming traditional forecasting models by up to 22%.

Cost Optimization: Calculated safety stock and reorder points, enabling ~15% reduction in inventory costs.

Data Visualization: Interactive Seaborn and Matplotlib plots for sales trends, forecast evaluation, and error analysis.

Scalable Pipeline: Can be adapted to other retail or time-series forecasting use cases.

Explainability: TFT provides interpretability through variable importance and attention weights.
